# ML Mini Project 

##  Project Description
This project applies multiple regression models to predict **hemoglobin levels** using a dataset containing features related to smoking and drinking habits. The goal is to compare different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

##  Dataset
- Dataset Name: `smoking_drinking_dataset_Ver01.csv`
- Features: Various health-related attributes including `sex`, `DRK_YN`, and more.
- Target Variable: `hemoglobin`

##  Models Implemented
The following **regression models** were trained and evaluated:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regression**
3. **Random Forest Regression**
4. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
5. **XGBoost Regression**
6. **LightGBM Regression**
7. **Ridge Regression**
8. **Lasso Regression**
9. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**
